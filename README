8086 Disassembler
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
An x86 disassembler which supports the original Intel 8086/8088 instructions.

This disassembler was written in x86 Assembly language during the first semester of Software Engineering programme in Vilnius University (VU).

Features
────────
∙	Supports every instruction from the original Intel 8086/8088 instruction set
∙	Small executable file size (less than 6KB)
∙	Fully-buffered file I/O
∙	Reads from and writes to files whose names are give as command-line arguments
∙	Prints helpful error messages for various different I/O errors

ToDo's
──────
―	[ ] Output the results in a more-readable DOS Debug format
―	[ ] Print a usage message when command-line arguments are supplied incorrectly

Usage
─────
This program was written for Turbo Assembler (TASM) and uses TASM specific features, so it should be Assembled with TASM.

The Assembled executable should be run with two positional arguments: input file name and output file name:
	Dis86 <input_file_name> <output_file_name>

For example, to disassemble an executable `test.com` and output the disassembly result into `test.asm`, run:
	Dis86 test.com test.asm

Notes
─────
∙	This program was intended to be used with COM files, hence the starting 0x0100 offset.
∙	The author assembled this program with Turbo Assembler 3.1 and linked with Turbo Link 3.0.
	All tests were run in a DOSBOX 0.74-3 environment.
